/**
 * Computes the inverse kinematics for one leg
 *
 * Input x, y and z are the targe cartesian position, 
 * in the referencial of the leg. The z axis is upward,
 * the x axis is alighed with the "0" angle of the first
 * servo.
 *
 * Output are a, b and c, angles for the three servos,
 * the first controls the yaw of the leg, through the
 * motor fixed on the body, and b and c controls the
 * length of the leg and the position of the end of 
 * the leg.
 *
 * l1, l2 and l3 are the length between the first motor
 * arm and the second motor arm, between the second and thr
 * third motor arm, and between the third motor arm and the
 * end of the leg.
